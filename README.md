# TrackIt

TrackIt is a modern personal finance management application designed to help users track income, expenses, investments, and savings. The project is currently in active development.

## Project Structure

- **client/**: Contains the React frontend application (fully functional).
- **server/**: (To be developed) Will contain the backend API and business logic.

## Status

- The **client** (React app) is implemented and provides a rich user interface for managing and visualizing personal finances.
- The **server** is not yet developed. All data is currently managed on the client side (e.g., using Zustand for state management and local persistence).

## Planned Features

- Backend server for user authentication, data persistence, and multi-user support.
- API endpoints for entries, budgets, and AI-powered insights.
- Secure data storage and privacy controls.
