### Updated Initial Requirement Document for the TrackIt Project

1. **Entry Management**  
   - Users should be able to add financial entries with attributes like date, type, category, and amount.  
   - Validate entries to ensure all required fields are filled and amounts are positive.  

2. **Summary Dashboard**  
   - Display a summary of income, expenses, investments, and savings.  
   - Include visual indicators like progress bars and percentages for budget utilization.  

3. **Budget Management**  
   - Users should be able to create, update, and delete budgets.  
   - Budgets should include attributes like type (expense, savings, investment), category, amount, period (monthly, quarterly, etc.), start date, and name.  

4. **Filtering**  
   - Provide filtering options for entries and budgets by type, category, date range, and period.

5. **AI Bot Integration**  
   - Integrate an AI-powered bot to handle user queries related to financial data.  
   - The bot should use a foundational AI model to analyze user data (entries and budgets) and provide meaningful answers.  
   - Example queries the bot should handle:  
     - "How much have I spent on groceries this month?"  
     - "What is my highest expense category?"  
     - "Am I on track with my savings goal?"  

6. **Data Privacy and Security**  
   - Ensure the AI bot only uses user data (entries and budgets) for answering queries.  
   - Implement strict data access controls to prevent unauthorized use of user data.  

7. **Progress Tracking**  
   - Calculate and display progress for each budget, including current spending, percentage used, and remaining amount.  
   - Ensure progress is capped at 100% and visually represented.  

8. **Interactive Dialogs**  
   - Use modal dialogs for adding and editing budgets and entries.  
   - Include confirmation dialogs for critical actions like budget deletion.  

9. **Data Visualization**  
   - Use charts or progress bars to visually represent income, expenses, investments, and savings.  
   - Ensure charts are responsive and styled consistently with the app's theme.  

10. **Responsive Design**  
    - Ensure the application is fully responsive and works seamlessly on different screen sizes.  
    - Use Tailwind CSS for consistent styling and theming.  

11. **Dark Mode Support**  
    - Provide a dark mode theme with appropriate color variables for background, text, and UI elements.  

12. **Localization and Formatting**  
    - Format numbers and currencies according to the Indian locale (`en-IN`).  
    - Ensure date formats are consistent and user-friendly.  

13. **AI Bot Features**  
    - The AI bot should not perform any actions or make changes to user data.  
    - It should only provide insights, summaries, and answers based on user queries.  
    - Ensure the bot can handle natural language queries effectively.  

14. **Data Persistence**  
    - Store budgets and entries in a centralized state management system (e.g., Zustand).  
    - Ensure data is persisted across sessions.  

15. **Scalability and Extensibility**  
    - Design the application to support future features like recurring budgets, advanced AI analytics, and multi-user support.  
    - Use modular components and maintainable code practices.  

This ensures the AI bot is strictly used for answering user queries based on their financial data, maintaining privacy and security while enhancing user experience.
